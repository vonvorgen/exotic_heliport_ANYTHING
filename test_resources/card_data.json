The work you make possible is life-changing. With this gift, you're helping Oxfam Australia provide the resources needed to transform the lives of people living in poverty. Whether you have given a goat, chicken, duck or even poo, they're all real items used in our projects around the world. We've been working with communities for more than 50 years and have learnt that simply giving hand outs is not the answer. Instead, we provide people with the skills and resources to help them create their own solutions to poverty. And we couldn't do this without the support of generous people like you. If you'd like more information about any aspect of our work, our Supporter Services staff would love to chat to you! Call us 1800 088 110 or visit www.oxfam.org.au.

If you get it wrong and the Gift Voucher is emailed to someone else who uses it, there’s not much we can do. Check, double check and even triple check before you buy it. Speaking of emails, sometimes pesky (but useful) spam filters send our emails into junk or spam folders. So, if you’ve not been thanked for your generous gift, it’s worth giving them a nudge because there might be something wonderful waiting for them in their junk or spam folder!
